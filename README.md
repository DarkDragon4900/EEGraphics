# EEGraphics
A simple repository that contains a few conversions of the "Graphics" class to EE, allowing one to draw lines, ellipses, rectangles. etc. in EE. Work-In-Progress

# Getting Started
This project is currently no more than a single class file.
Copy the contents of the Graphix.cs file into a .cs file in your project (Project -> Add Class Alt+Shift+C)
Last but not least, use 
```C#
Graphix.(preferredItem)(params);
```
to get your line/ellipse/rectangle.
